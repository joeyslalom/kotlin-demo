01 bean
* Kotlin in inspired by many languages - including Java - and supports many ways of programming
* Although you can reproduce many patterns in Kotlin you are already familiar with, it can be improved dramatically
* Kotlin and Java live together in a project
* IntelliJ has a convenient Java to Kotlin converter (demo)
* In addition to reducing boilerplate, Kotlin makes classes conceptually more lightweight -> easier to use! (demo)

02 properties
* Kotlin has an interesting approach - it leans heavily on its standard library rather than machinery in the language itself
* Coroutines is an example - it only added one keyword (suspend), and most of the implementation is the library
* Delegation is another - this also allows the application to encaspulate database access, validation logic, etc (demo)
